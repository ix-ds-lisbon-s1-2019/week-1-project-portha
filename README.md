# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live but hasn't been edited to include an informative title, posts etc. Poker game doesn't execute and the code doesn't look very coherent.

Other instructions such as explaining the Python file in a README/blog post haven't been followed.
